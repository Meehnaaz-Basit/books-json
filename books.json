    "review": "The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a provocative and philosophical exploration of vanity, morality, and the pursuit of beauty. The novel follows the young and handsome Dorian Gray, who becomes the subject of a painted portrait by the talented artist Basil Hallward.\n\nAs Dorian indulges in a life of hedonism and debauchery, he remains outwardly youthful and unblemished, while the portrait reflects the true consequences of his immoral actions. Wilde's prose is rich with wit and insight, as he delves into the nature of art, the corrupting influence of society, and the duality of human nature.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray remains a timeless classic that challenges societal norms and confronts the reader with profound questions about the nature of beauty, the power of art, and the consequences of unchecked desire. Wilde's masterful storytelling and keen observations make The Picture of Dorian Gray a captivating and thought-provoking read that continues to resonate with readers today.",
